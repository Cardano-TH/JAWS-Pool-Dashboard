### JAWS pool Grafana -dashboard for Cardano blockchain pool operators

This is the Grafana dashboard setup we are using at our pools **JAWS** *for getting most*  information from both Core's and Relays.

The dashboard has been crafted with **sisu** and passion for the whole Cardano ecosystem.

The original dashboard has been made by the Umed Saidov (Operator of the [SKY] Pool)

1. For setting this up you need to create individual instances on your VM's or docker / container instances 
   in order to get data from core/relay's into the actual server, where you run your grafana.

   To do so install node_exporter and prometheus.

2. Also create the data sources into the grafana setup to fetch every VM / container data into the grafana.

3. Most easiest if running your instances in VM or docker is to use the internal IP- addresses at the grafana source setup.

4. Feel free to ask more help at Telegram via PM
